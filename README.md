Concise Binary Encoding
=======================

A machine-readable, compact representation of semi-structured hierarchical data.

Designed with the following points of focus:

  * General purpose encoding for a large number of applications
  * Supports the most common data types
  * Supports hierarchical data structuring
  * Binary format to minimize parsing costs
  * Little endian byte ordering to allow native reading directly off the wire
  * Compact data in ways that don't affect reading directly of the wire
  * Balanced space and computation efficiency
  * Minimal complexity
