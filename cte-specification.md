Concise Text Encoding
=====================

Concise Text Encoding (CTE) is the text variant of Concise Encoding: a general purpose, human and machine friendly, compact representation of semi-structured hierarchical data.

The text format aims to present data in a human friendly way, while the 1:1 compatible [binary format](cbe-specification.md) aims for compactness and machine processing efficiency.

CTE documents must follow the [Concise Encoding structural rules](ce-structure.md).

General
-------

A CTE document is a UTF-8 encoded text document containing data arranged in an ad-hoc hierarchical fashion.

Whitespace is used to separate elements in a container. In maps, the key and value portions of a key-value pair are separated by an equals character (`=`) and possible whitespace. The key-value pairs themselves are separated by whitespace. Extraneous whitespace is ignored.

**Examples**:

 * CTE v1 empty document: `c1`
 * CTE v1 document containing the top-level integer value 1000: `c1 1000`
 * CTE v1 document containing a top-level list: `c1 [a b c]`
 * CTE v1 document containing a top-level map: `c1 [a=1 b=2 c=3]`


### Human Editability

A CTE document must be editable by a human. This means that it must contain only valid UTF-8 characters and sequences that can actually be viewed, entered and modified in a UTF-8 capable text editor. Unicode runes that have no width or visibility or direct input method, or are reserved or permanently marked as non-characters, must not be present in the document.

In the spirit of human editability:

 * Implementations and document creators should avoid easily confused or otherwise difficult to use characters outside of quoted strings.
 * Implementations should avoid outputting characters that editors tend to convert automatically.
 * Line lengths should be kept within reasonable amounts in order to avoid excessive horizontal scrolling in an editor.
 * Implementations should convert structural line endings to the operating system's native format when saving a document to disk. See: [line endings](#line-endings)
 * If a certain character is likely to be confusing or problematic, it's encouraged to use an escape sequence instead.


### Line Endings

Line endings can be encoded as LF only (u+000a) or CR+LF (u+000d u+000a) to maintain compatibility with editors on various popular platforms. However, for data transmission, the canonical format is LF only. Decoders must accept all encodings as input, but encoders should only output LF when the destination is a foreign or unknown system.


### Escape Sequences

Some kinds of data may contain information that cannot be safely represented in textual form in a CTE document. In these cases, escape sequences may be used to encode the data. For these data types, `\` acts as an escape sequence initiator, and the following escape sequences are recognized:

| Sequence                                    | Interpretation                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `\`, u+000a                                 | [continuation](#continuation) |
| `\`, u+000d, u+000a                         | [continuation](#continuation) |
| `\t`                                        | horizontal tab (u+0009)       |
| `\n`                                        | linefeed (u+000a)             |
| `\r`                                        | carriage return (u+000d)      |
| `\"`                                        | double quote (u+0022)         |
| `\|`                                        | pipe (u+007c)                 |
| `\\`                                        | backslash (u+005c)            |
| `\*`                                        | asterisk (u+002a)             |
| `\/`                                        | slash (u+002f)                |
| `\<`                                        | less-than (u+003c)            |
| `\>`                                        | greater-than (u+003e)         |
| `` \` ``                                    | backtick (u+0060)             |
| [Unicode escape](#unicode-escape-sequences) | Unicode character             |

**Note**: The `*` and `/` characters can be escaped to avoid edge cases with [comments](#comment).

#### Unicode Escape Sequences

Unicode characters can in some string contexts be encoded using unicode escape sequences, which begin with a backslash (`\`) character, followed by one digit (`0`-`9`) specifying the number of hex digits encoding the codepoint, followed by that number of hex digits (`0`-`f`) representing the hexadecimal value of the codepoint.

Examples:

| Sequence  | Digits | Character     |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `\0`      | 0      | NUL           |
| `\16`     | 1      | ACK           |
| `\27f`    | 2      | DEL           |
| `\3101`   | 3      | ƒÅ  (a macron) |
| `\42191`  | 4      | ‚Üë  (up arrow) |
| `\51f415` | 5      | üêï (dog)      |

#### Continuation

A continuation causes the decoder to ignore all whitespace characters until it reaches the next printable character.

Example:

```
    "The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, \
     mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or \
     say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles \
     exploding like spiders across the stars."
```

The above string is interpreted as:

```
The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.
```



Version Specifier
-----------------

A CTE document begins with a version specifier, which is composed of the character `c` (0x63), followed by a version number. There must be no whitespace between the `c` and the version number.

The version specifier and the top-level object (if present) must be separated by whitespace.

**Example**:

Version specifier (CTE version 1): `c1`



Numeric Types
-------------

### Boolean

Represented by the values `@true` and `@false`.


### Integer

Integer values can be positive or negative, and can be represented in various bases. Negative values are prefixed with a dash `-` as a sign character. Values must be written in lower case.

Integers can be specified in base 2, 8, 10, or 16. Bases other than 10 require a prefix:

| Base | Name        | Digits           | Prefix | Example      | Decimal Equivalent |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
|   2  | Binary      | 01               | `0b`   | `-0b1100`    | -12                |
|   8  | Octal       | 01234567         | `0o`   | `0o755`      | 493                |
|  10  | Decimal     | 0123456789       |        | `900000`     | 900000             |
|  16  | Hexadecimal | 0123456789abcdef | `0x`   | `0xdeadbeef` | 3735928559         |

**Examples**:

    50000
    -123


### Floating Point

A floating point number is composed of a whole part and a fractional part, separated by a dot `.`, with an optional exponential portion. Negative values are prefixed with a dash `-`.

**Examples**:

    1.0
    -98.413

#### Base-10 Notation

The exponential portion of a base-10 number is denoted by the lowercase character `e`, followed by the signed size of the exponent (using `+` for positive and `-` for negative). The exponent's sign character can be omitted if it's positive. The exponent portion is a signed base-10 number representing the power-of-10 to multiply the significand by. Values should be normalized (only one digit to the left of the decimal point) when using exponential notation.

 * `6.411e+9` = 6411000000
 * `6.411e9` = 6411000000
 * `6.411e-9` = 0.000000006411

There is no maximum number of significant digits or exponent digits, but care should be taken to ensure that the receiving end will be able to store the value. 64-bit ieee754 floating point values, for example, can store up to 16 significant digits.

#### Base-16 Notation

Base-16 floating point numbers allow 100% accurate representation of ieee754 binary floating point values. They begin with `0x`, and the exponential portion is denoted by the lowercase character `p`. The exponential portion is a signed base-10 number representing the power-of-2 to multiply the significand by. The exponent's sign character can be omitted if it's positive. Values should be normalized.

 * `0xa.3fb8p+42` = a.3fb8 x 2 ^ 42
 * `0x1.0p0` = 1

Base-10 floating point notation should be preferred over base-16 notation. Decimal floating point values tend to be smaller, and also avoid the false precision of binary floating point values. [More info](https://github.com/kstenerud/compact-float/blob/master/compact-float-specification.md#how-much-precision-do-you-need)

#### Special Floating Point Values

 * `@inf`: Infinity
 * `-@inf`: Negative Infinity
 * `@nan`: Not a Number (quiet)
 * `@snan`: Not a Number (signaling)

#### Floating Point Rules

**There must be one (and only one) dot character:**

| Value          | Notes              |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| `1`            | Integer, not float |
| `1.0`          | Float              |
| `500000000000` | Integer, not float |
| `5.0e+11`      | Float              |
| `5e+11`        | Invalid            |
| `10.4.5`       | Invalid            |

**There must be at least one digit on each side of the dot character:**

| Invalid      | Valid     | Notes                                                |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `-1.`        | `-1.0`    | Or use integer value `-1`                            |
| `.1`         | `0.1`     |                                                      |
| `.218901e+2` | `21.8901` | Or `2.18901e+1`                                      |
| `-0`         | `-0.0`    | Special case: -0 cannot be represented as an integer |


### Numeric Whitespace

The `_` character can be used as "numeric whitespace" when encoding numeric values. Other [whitespace](#whitespace) characters are not allowed.

Rules:

 * Only [integer](#integer) and [floating point](#floating-point) types can contain numeric whitespace.
 * [Named values](#named-values) (such as `@nan` and `@inf`) must not contain whitespace.
 * Values can contain any amount of whitespace at any point after the first character.
 * There must not be numeric whitespace between the exponent marker (`e`, `p`) and the first digit of the exponent.
 * There must not be numeric whitespace between the exponent sign (`+`, `-`) and the first digit of the exponent.

| Value       | Valid Whitespace     | Invalid Whitespace | Notes                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `1000000`   | `1__000___000____`   | `_1_000_000`       | `_1_000_000` would be interpreted as a string |
| `1.5e50`    | `1_._5_e5_0`         | `1.5e_50`          |                                               |
| `1.5e+50`   | `1_._5_e+5_0`        | `1.5e_+50`         |                                               |

Numeric whitespace characters must be ignored when decoding numeric values.


### UUID

The 128-bit universally unique identifier begins with an at (`@`) character, and must follow definition of the UUID string representation in [rfc4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).

Example:

    @123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000



Temporal Types
--------------

Temporal types record time with varying degrees of precision.

Fields other than year can be pre-padded with zeros (`0`) up to their maximum allowed digits for aesthetic reasons if desired. Minutes and seconds must always be padded to 2 digits.


### Date

A date is made up of the following fields, separated by a dash character (`-`):

| Field | Mandatory | Min Value | Max Value | Max Digits |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Year  |     Y     |         * |         * |          * |
| Month |     Y     |         1 |        12 |          2 |
| Day   |     Y     |         1 |        31 |          2 |

 * BC years are prefixed with a dash (`-`).

**Examples**:

 * `2019-8-5`: August 5, 2019
 * `5081-03-30`: March 30, 5081
 * `-300-12-21`: December 21, 300 BC (proleptic Gregorian)



### Time

A time is made up of the following fields:

| Field        | Mandatory | Separator | Min Value | Max Value | Max Digits |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Hour         |     Y     |           |         0 |        23 |          2 |
| Minute       |     Y     |    `:`    |         0 |        59 |          2 |
| Second       |     Y     |    `:`    |         0 |        60 |          2 |
| Subseconds   |     N     |    `.`    |         0 | 999999999 |          9 |
| Time Zone    |     N     |    `/`    |         - |         - |          - |

 * Minutes and seconds must always be padded to 2 digits.
 * If the time zone is unspecified, it is assumed to be `Zero` (UTC).

**Examples**:

 * `9:04:21`: 9:04:21 UTC
 * `23:59:59.999999999`: 23:59:59 and 999999999 nanoseconds UTC
 * `12:05:50.102/Z`: 12:05:50 and 102 milliseconds UTC
 * `4:00:00/Asia/Tokyo`: 4:00:00 Tokyo time
 * `17:41:03/-13.54/-172.36`: 17:41:03 Samoa time
 * `9:00:00/L`: 9:00:00 local time


### Timestamp

A timestamp combines a date and a time, separated by a slash character (`/`).

**Examples**:

 * `2019-01-23/14:08:51.941245`: January 23, 2019, at 14:08:51 and 941245 microseconds, UTC
 * `1985-10-26/01:20:01.105/M/Los_Angeles`: October 26, 1985, at 1:20:01 and 105 milliseconds, Los Angeles time
 * `5192-11-01/03:00:00/48.86/2.36`: November 1st, 5192, at 3:00:00, at whatever is in the place of Paris at that time


### Time Zones

The time zone is an optional field. If omitted, it is assumed to be `Zero` (UTC).

#### Area/Location

An area/location time zone is written in the form `Area/Location`.

**Examples**:

 * `E/Paris`
 * `America/Vancouver`
 * `Etc/UTC` == `Zero` == `Z`
 * `L`


#### Global Coordinates

Global coordinates are written as latitude and longitude to hundredths of degrees, separated by a slash character (`/`). Negative values are prefixed with a dash character (`-`), and the period character (`.`) is used as a decimal separator.

**Examples**:

 * `51.60/11.11`
 * `-13.53/-172.37`



Array Types
-----------

The standard array encoding format consists of a pipe character (`|`), followed by the array type, whitespace, the contents, and finally a closing pipe. Depending on the kind of array, the contents are encoded either as whitespace-separated elements, or as a string-like sequence representing the contents:

    |type elem1 elem2 elem3 ...|
    |type contents represented as a string|

An empty array has a type but no contents:

    |type|

The following array types are available:

| Type   | Description             | Encoding Kind |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| `b`    | Boolean                 | Element       |
| `u8`   | 8-bit unsigned integer  | Element       |
| `u16`  | 16-bit unsigned integer | Element       |
| `u32`  | 32-bit unsigned integer | Element       |
| `u64`  | 64-bit unsigned integer | Element       |
| `i8`   | 8-bit signed integer    | Element       |
| `i16`  | 16-bit signed integer   | Element       |
| `i32`  | 32-bit signed integer   | Element       |
| `i64`  | 64-bit signed integer   | Element       |
| `f16`  | 16-bit floating point   | Element       |
| `f32`  | 32-bit floating point   | Element       |
| `f64`  | 64-bit floating point   | Element       |
| `uu`   | 128-bit UUID            | Element       |
| `u`    | URI                     | String-Like   |
| `ct`   | Custom Text             | String-Like   |
| `cb`   | Custom Binary           | Element       |


### Element Array Encodings

For element array encodings, any valid representation of the element data type may be used, provided the value fits within the type's width. 

#### Implied Prefix

Optionally, a suffix can be appended to the type specifier (if the type supports it) to indicate that all values must be considered to have an implicit prefix.

| Suffix | Implied element prefix | Example                       |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `b`    | `0b`                   | `|u8b 10011010 00010101|`     |
| `o`    | `0o`                   | `|i16o -7445 644|`            |
| `x`    | `0x`                   | `|f32x a.c9fp20 -1.ffe9p-40|` |

#### Special Rules

 * UUID array elements may optionally be represented without the initial `@` sentinel.
 * Boolean array elements may optionally be represented using `0` for false and `1` for true. Whitespace is optional when encoding a boolean array using `0` and `1` (e.g. `1001` = `1 0 0 1` = `true false false true`)

**Examples**:

    |u8x 9f 47 cb 9a 3c|
    |f32 1.5 0x4.f391p100 30 9.31e-30|
    |i16 0b1001010 0o744 1000 0xffff|
    |uu 3a04f62f-cea5-4d2a-8598-bc156b99ea3b 1d4e205c-5ea3-46ea-92a3-98d9d3e6332f|
    |b true true false true false|
    |b 1 1 0 1 0|
    |b 11010|


### String-Like Array Encodings

String-like array encodings are interpreted as a whole, and must not contain control characters, non-printable characters, pipe (`|`) or backslash (`\`) unless encoded as [escape sequences](#escape-sequences).


### URI

A Concise Encoding implementation must not interpret percent escape sequences in URIs, and must not generate percent escape sequences; they must be passed untouched. CTE [escape sequences](#escape-sequences), however, must be interpreted.

 * `|u http://x.y.z?pipe=\||` decodes to `http://x.y.z?pipe=|`,  which the upper layers interpret as `http://x.y.z?pipe=|`
 * `|u http://x.y.z?pipe=%7c|` decodes to `http://x.y.z?pipe=%7c`,  which the upper layers interpret as `http://x.y.z?pipe=|`


### Custom Binary

Custom binary data is encoded like `u8x`: as hex encoded byte elements.

**Example**:

    |cb 04 f6 28 3c 40 00 00 40 40|


### Custom Text

Custom text data is encoded using string-like encoding.

**Example**:

    |ct cplx(2.94+3i)|


### String

Strings are delimited differently from other array types in order to be more human friendly. There are three methods for encoding a string:

 * [Quoted sequence](#quoted-string)
 * [Verbatim sequence](#verbatim-string)
 * [Unquoted string](#unquoted-string)

#### Quoted String

A quoted string encloses the string contents within double-quote delimiters (for example: `"a string"`). All characters leading up to the closing double-quote (including whitespace) are considered part of the string sequence. A quoted string must not contain control characters, non-printable characters, double-quotes (`"`) or backslash (`\`) unless encoded as [escape sequences](#escape-sequences).

**Example**:

    "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"

#### Verbatim String

CTE encodes verbatim strings using a method similar to "here" documents in Bash, composed as follows:

 * Backtick (`` ` ``).
 * An end-of-string identifier, which is a sequence of printable, non-whitespace characters (in accordance with [human editability](cte-specification.md#human-editability)).
 * A whitespace terminator to terminate the end-of-string identifier (either: SPACE `u+0020`, TAB `u+0009`, LF `u+000a`, or CR+LF `u+000d u+000a`).
 * The string contents.
 * A second instance of the end-of-string identifier (no whitespace termination necessary).

**Example**:

```
`@@@ In verbatim strings, everything is interpreted literally until the
end-of-string identifier is encountered (in this case three @ characters).
Characters like ", [, <, \ and such can appear unescaped.

Whitespace, including newlines and "leading" whitespace, is also read verbatim.
        For example, this line really is indented 8 spaces.

There is no trailing newline in this example.@@@
```

#### Unquoted String

Strings must normally be delimited, but this rule can be relaxed if:

 * The string doesn't begin with a character from u+0000 to u+007f, with the exception of lowercase a-z, uppercase A-Z, and underscore (`_`).
 * The string doesn't contain characters from u+0000 to u+007f, with the exception of lowercase a-z, uppercase A-Z, numerals 0-9, underscore (`_`), dash (`-`), period (`.`), and colon (`:`).
 * The above two rules also apply to Unicode characters that LOOK similar to the excluded characters for a human (for example u+2052 `‚Åí`, u+ff11 `Ôºë`).
 * The string doesn't contain escape sequences or whitespace or line breaks or unprintable characters.
 * The string isn't empty.

For example, these cannot be unquoted strings:

    "String with spaces"
    "String\twith\ttabs\nand\nnewlines"
    "special*chars"
    ".begins-with-a-dot"
    "twenty‚Äêfive" /* Using the u+2010 hyphen instead of u+002d */

These can be unquoted strings:

    twenty-five
    Std:value.next
    _contains_underscores
    _150
    È£≤„ÅøÁâ©



Container Types
---------------

### List

A list begins with an opening square bracket `[`, whitespace separated contents, and finally a closing bracket `]`.

**Example**:

    [1 two 3.1 {} @null]


### Map

Map entries are split into key-value pairs using the equals `=` character and optional whitespace. Key-value pairs must be separated from each other using whitespace. A key without a paired value is invalid.

A map begins with an opening curly brace `{`, whitespace separated key-value pairs, and finally a closing brace `}`.

**Example**:

    {
        1 = alpha
        2 = beta
        "a map" = {one=1 two=2}
    }


### Markup

The CTE encoding of a markup container is similar to XML, except:

 * There are no end tags. All data is contained within the begin `<`, content begin `;`, and end `>` characters.
 * Comments are encoded using `/*` and `*/` instead of `<!--` and `-->`, and can be nested.
 * [Unquoted strings](#unquoted-string) are allowed in markup names and attribute values.
 * Non-string types can be used in attribute names and values, under the same rules as [map](#map) keys and values.

#### Markup Structure

| Section    | Delimiter  | Type                      | Required |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| Tag name   | `<`        | [Keyable](#keyable-types) | Y        |
| Attributes | whitespace | [Map](#map)               |          |
| Contents   | `;`        | [List](#list)             |          |
| End        | `>`        |                           | Y        |

Attributes and contents are optional. There must be whitespace between the container name and the attributes section (if present), and there can optionally be whitespace adjacent to the begin, contents, and end delimiters.

Illustration of markup encodings:

| Attributes | Children | Example                                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|     N      |    N     | `<br>`                                                     |
|     Y      |    N     | `<div id=fillme>`                                          |
|     N      |    Y     | `<span;Some text here>`                                    |
|     Y      |    Y     | `<ul id=mylist style=boring; <li;first> <li;second> >`     |

The contents section is in string processing mode whenever it's not processing a sub-container or comment (initiated by an unescaped `<` character).

##### Container End

The markup container ends when an unescaped `>` character is encountered while processing a [content string](#content-string). There are no separate "end tags" or slash character encoding like in XML.

##### Content String

Content strings can contain escape sequences, which must be processed before applying the structural rules for content strings.

An unescaped backtick (`` ` ``) character initiates a [verbatim string](#verbatim-string). When a verbatim string is initiated, the current string is terminated (added to the current [contents section](#content-section)) and a new verbatim string begins. Once the verbatim string completes, it is added to the current contents section and a new regular content string begins.

**Example**:

```
c1
<View;
    <Image src=u"images/avatar-image.jpg">
    <Text;
        Hello! Please choose a name!
    >
    /* <HRule style=thin> */
    <TextInput id=name style={height=40 borderColor=gray}; Name me! >
>
```



Pseudo-Objects
--------------

### Marker

A marker sequence consists of the following, with no whitespace in between:

 * `&` (the marker initiator)
 * A marker ID
 * `:` (the marker separator)
 * The marked value

Example:

    [
        &remember_me:"Pretend that this is a huge string"
        &1:{a = 1}
    ]

The string `"Pretend that this is a huge string"` is marked with the ID `remember_me`, and the map `{a=1}` is marked with the ID `1`.


### Reference

A reference begins with the reference initiator (`$`), followed immediately (with no whitespace) by either a [marker ID](#marker-id) or a [URI](#uri).

Example:

    {
        some_object = {
            my_string = &big_string:"Pretend that this is a huge string"
            my_map = &1:{
                a = 1
            }
        }

        reference_to_string = $big_string
        reference_to_map = $1
        reference_to_local_doc = $|u common.cte|
        reference_to_remote_doc = $|u https://somewhere.com/my_document.cbe?format=long|
        reference_to_local_doc_marker = $|u common.cte#legalese|
        reference_to_remote_doc_marker = $|u https://somewhere.com/my_document.cbe?format=long#examples|
    }


### Metadata Map

Metadata maps are encoded in the same manner as [regular maps](#map), except that they are enclosed within parenthesis `(`, `)`.

**Example**:

    c1
    // Metadata for the entire document
    (
        _ct = 2017.01.14-15:22:41/Z
        _mt = 2019.08.17-12:44:31/Z
    )
    {
        records = [
            // Metadata for "ABC Corp" record
            (
                _ct = 2019.05.14-10:22:55/Z
                _t = [longtime_client big_purchases]
            )
            {
                client = "ABC Corp"
                amount = 10499.28
                due = 2020.05.14
            }
        ]
    }


### Comment

Comment contents must contain only complete and valid UTF-8 sequences. Escape sequences in comments are not interpreted (they are passed through verbatim).

Comments must be separated from other objects and structural characters by whitespace.

Comment contents must be trimmed (leading and trailing whitespace removed) when decoding, and must be separated from the comment delimiters by whitespace when encoding.

| Invalid                         | Valid                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `1.2//A comment`                | `1.2 // A comment`                        |
| `{a/*x*/=b}`                    | `{a /* x */ =b}`                          |
| `[1 2 3/**/]`                   | `[1 2 3 /**/ ]`                           |
| `/**/{/**/a/**/=/**/b/**/}/**/` | `/**/ { /**/ a /**/ = /**/ b /**/ } /**/` |

Comments can be written in single-line or multi-line form.

Implementations must allow the user to choose whether to receive or ignore comments.

#### Single Line Comment

A single line comment begins at the sequence `//` and continues until the next linefeed (u+000a) is encountered.

#### Multiline Comment

A multiline comment begins at the sequence `/*` and is terminated by the sequence `*/`. Multiline comments support nesting, meaning that further `/*` sequences inside the comment will start subcomments that must also be terminated by their own `*/` sequence. No processing of the comment contents other than detecting comment begin and comment end is peformed.

Commenting out strings or markup contents containing the sequences `/*` or `*/` will potentially cause parse errors because the parser won't have any contextual information about the sequences, and will simply treat them as "comment begin" and "comment end". You could mitigate this edge case by escaping all occurrences of `/*` and `*/` that don't represent comment delimiters:

#### Comment String Character Restrictions

The following characters are explicitly allowed:

 * Horizontal Tab (u+0009)
 * Linefeed (u+000a) - discarded in single line comments
 * Carriage Return (u+000d) - discarded in single line comments

The following characters are disallowed if they aren't in the above allowed section:

 * Control characters (such as u+0000 to u+001f, u+007f to u+009f).
 * Line breaking characters (such as u+2028, u+2029).
 * Byte order mark.

The following characters are allowed if they aren't in the above disallowed section:

 * UTF-8 printable characters
 * UTF-8 whitespace characters

**Example**:

```
c1
// Comment before top level object
{
    // Comment before the "name" object.
    // And another comment.
    "name" = "Joe Average" // Comment after the "Joe Average" object.

    "email" = // Comment after the "email" key.
    /* Multiline comment with nested comment inside
      u"mailto:joe@average.org"
      /* Unlike in C, nested multiline
         comments are allowed */
    */
    u"mailto:someone@somewhere.com"

    "data" // Comment after data
    =
    // Comment before some binary data (but not inside it)
    |u8x 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a|
}
```


Other Types
-----------

### Null

Null is encoded as `@null`



Letter Case
-----------

A CTE document must be entirely in lower case, except in the following cases:

 * String and comment contents: `"A string can contain UPPER CASE. Escape sequences must be lower case: \x3d"`
 * URI contents.
 * [Time zones](#time-zones) are case sensitive, and contain uppercase characters.
 * [Marker IDs](#marker-id) are not case sensitive, but case must still be preserved when converting between formats.

Everything else, including hexadecimal digits, exponents, and escape sequences, must be lower case.

A decoder must accept uppercase letters for case-insensitive data, because humans will do this regardless of the rules.

An encoder must output letter case in accordance with this specification.



Whitespace
----------

Whitespace characters outside of strings and comments must be ignored by a CTE parser. Any number of whitespace characters can occur in a sequence.


### Valid Whitespace Characters

While there are many characters classified as "whitespace" within the Unicode set, only the following are valid whitespace characters in a CTE document:

| Code Point | Name            |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| u+0009     | horizontal tab  |
| u+000a     | line feed       |
| u+000d     | carriage return |
| u+0020     | space           |


### Whitespace **can** occur:

 * Before an object.
 * After an object.
 * Between container delimiters: `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `;`, `>`
 * Between array delimiters `|`.

Examples:

 * `[   1     2      3 ]` is equivalent to `[1 2 3]`
 * `| u8x 01   02 03   04 |` is equivalent to `|u8x 01 02 03 04|`
 * `{ 1="one" 2 = "two" 3= "three" 4 ="four"}` is equivalent to `{1="one" 2="two" 3="three" 4="four"}`


### Whitespace **must** occur:

 * Between the [version specifier](#version-specifier) and the first object.
 * Between the end-of-string identifier and the beginning of the data in a [verbatim string](#verbatim-string).
 * Between typed array element type specifiers and contents, and between typed array elements.
 * Between values in a [list](#list) (`["one""two"]` is invalid).
 * Between key-value pairs in a [map](#map), [metadata map](#metadata-map), or [markup attributes](#attributes-section) (`{1="one"2="two"}` is invalid).
 * Between a markup's [tag name](#markup-tag-name) and its [attributes](#attributes-section) (if attributes are present).
 * Between an object and a comment (`[ a/**/ ]` is invalid).


### Whitespace **must not** occur:

 * Before the [version specifier](#version-specifier).
 * Between an array encoding type and the opening double-quote (`u "` is invalid).
 * Between a marker or reference initiator and its marker ID (`& 1234` and `# u"mydoc.cbe"` are invalid).
 * Between a marker ID and the object it marks (`&123: xyz` is invalid).
 * Splitting a time value (`2018.07.01-10 :53:22.001481/Z` is invalid).
 * Splitting a numeric value (`0x3 f`, `9. 41`, `3 000`, `9.3 e+3`, `- 1.0` are invalid). Use the numeric whitespace character (`_`) instead.
 * Splitting named values: (`@t rue`, `@ null`, `@i nf`, `@n a n` are invalid).
